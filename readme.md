# Advent of code 2022

This is my repository for advent of code 2022 written in rust. I'm learning about
Rust as I go about each day in this series of challenges. Sometiimes, I feel like I'm about
to wrip my hairs out. Other times, I feel like I love the language.

Right now, I'm in a love-hate relationsip with this programming language. Hoepfully as time goes by,
this will get better.

Some things I have learned about rust:

- Implementing a linked list is HARD
- Implementing a tree is HARD
- Lifetimes get complicated very fast
- Conventional C++/Java OOP style doesn't work here :(
- Ownership of variables/resources get complicated
